# GW_higher_harmonics_search
This repo has data products form the IAS GW search with higher harmonics.

Please feel free to email me at jayw@ias.edu if there are any issues or you need
more files or data than currently uploaded here.


1. The PE samples for the new events described in [arXiv:2312.06631](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06631) 
and the candidates catalog (containing above and below threshold candidates),
which contains details such as t_gps, can be downloaded from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YkuIo-yIJhIOSX3B0zRGlSJzwIT5D61U?usp=sharing)

We provide a basic notebook in the folder to show how to read the data and make corner plots
using cogwheel.

2. The jupyter notebook to create a HM template bank described in [arXiv:2310.15233](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15233) will be available in January.
 Sorry for the delay.
