# GW_higher_harmonics_search
This repo has data products form the IAS GW search with higher harmonics.

The jupyter notebook to create a HM template bank described in arXiv: 2310.15233
will be available in mid-November. Sorry for the delay as I'm traveling right now.

Please feel free to email me at jayw@ias.edu if there are any issues or you need
more files or data than currently uploaded here.
